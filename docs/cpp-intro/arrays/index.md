# Working with the Array Class

This guide introduces the `Array<>` class, a beginner-friendly alternative to the standard C++ vector. The `Array<>` class provides helpful error messages and safety features to make working with collections of data easier for new programmers.

The Array class is similar to a standard vector, but with additional safety features and simplified methods designed specifically for beginner programmers.

## Key Features

- **Range checking**: Prevents out-of-bounds errors with helpful messages
- **Simple syntax**: Easy-to-remember methods for common operations
- **Beginner-friendly**: Designed for students new to programming
- **Safe operations**: Clear error messages instead of mysterious crashes

## Getting Started

To use the `Array<>` class, include the appropriate header file:

```cpp
#include "array.h"
```
