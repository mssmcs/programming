# Variables

Variables are named storage locations in memory that hold values. In C++, you must declare a variableâ€™s type before using it.

## Declaring Variables

    int age = 25;        // Integer variable
    double salary = 55000.50;  // Floating-point variable
    char grade = 'A';    // Character variable

Variables can be modified after declaration:

    age = 26;  // Updates the value of age
